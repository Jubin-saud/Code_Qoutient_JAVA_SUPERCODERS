Constraints : Do not declare any global variables. Do not use any loops; you must use recursion. You can declare as many primitive variables like ints as you like. You are allowed to define other "helper" functions if you like; they are subject to these same constraints


import java.util.Scanner;
// Other imports go here
// Do NOT change the class name
class Main{
  public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        PFactors(n);
    }
    public static void PFactors( int num)
    {
        int i = 2;
        if( num == 1 )
            return;
        while( num%i != 0 )
            i++;
        System.out.println(i);
        PFactors(num/i);
    }
}
