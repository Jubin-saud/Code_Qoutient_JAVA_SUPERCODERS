Strings are basically array of characters that represent some textual data in a program.

Given two strings, use strcmp() function to compare them and print the result as below:

If both strings are same, print "Equal", If first string is lexicographically smaller than second, print "Small" else print "Large"

Input Format

First line contains the first string.
Second line contains the second string.
Output Format

Print the result based on comparison of string.
Sample Input

Code
Quotient
Sample Output

Small
Explanation

strcmp() will compare the strings and work as below:
return 0; if both strings are equal
return -ve value: if first string is lexicographically smaller than second
return +ve value: if first string is lexicographically larger than second


import java.util.Scanner;
// Other imports go here
// Do NOT change the class name
class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Write your code here
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String a = sc.nextLine();
        String b = sc.nextLine();
        if (a.equals(b)){
            System.out.println("Equal");
        }
        else if(a.length() < b.length()){
            System.out.println("Small");
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("Large");
        }
    }
}
